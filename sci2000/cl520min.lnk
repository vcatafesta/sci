#  CL520MIN.LNK - 03/22/93 Version 1.0
#
#  Blinker link script for CA-Clipper 5.2
#
#  Minimal overlaying - overlay EXTEND.LIB
#
#  For ease of use this script should be stored in your library
#  directory, (the directory pointed to by the LIB environment variable),
#  which will allow Blinker to find the script without you having to
#  specify a full path.
#
#  This script must be included outside of any BEGINAREA / ENDAREA commands
#  and after all libraries except the RDDs and LLIBCA if it is being used.
#
#  example:
#
#  FILE one
#  BEGINAREA
#       FILE two
#       FILE three
#       FILE four
#  ENDAREA
#  @CL520MIN
#  LIB DBFCDX
#  LIB LLIBCA # (if used)


# mod tbrowse0            #  Uncomment these three lines
# mod tbrowse1            #  to speed up TBROWSE by forcing
# mod linelen             #  it into the root.
