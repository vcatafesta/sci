The object file contained herein fixes a
problem when a Clipper program uses certain
CA-TOOLS III functions and is run on fast
Intel, Cyrix, and AMD CPUs. These processors
run timing loops so fast that the Clipper
program immediately terminates with an error
message, usually "R6003 divide-by-zero" or
"unexpected interrupt."
