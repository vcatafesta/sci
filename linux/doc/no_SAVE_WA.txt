  No_Save_WA = 1           -    server mode of internally handling database tables 
                                    1  each dbUseArea() will cause a real file open operation by the OS,
                                       identical to what client requested, so workareas at the server are same as
                                       at client side. [ WA number, alias, filter conditions, relations ]
                                    0  each table is opened only one time, this workarea 'exchanged' in between client
                                       requests. so only one connection will have access to the table at a time.
                                       No relations active at server, Alias names at server are different from 
                                       the client.
                                    Recommend '1' if you plan to execute functions at server side ( UDF ).

      Share_Tables = 0         -    other software simultanous access tables used by server,
                                    which changes logical or physical locking -- in dependance:
                                    # No_Save_WA = 0    
                                    0  server open all tables in exclusive mode, what leads to
                                       performance increase as e.g. record-/ file- locks are not applied by OS.
                                    1  tables are opened in the same mode [shared/exclusive] as client
                                       applications opened them, what allows LetoDB to work in coexistence with
                                       other applications [ non LetoDB users ] simultanous on the same DBF tables.
                                    # No_Save_WA = 1
                                    1  physical record-/ file- locks set with the OS are viewable for other
                                    0  only logical internally locking
